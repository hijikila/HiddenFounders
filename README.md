# HiddenFounders Coding Challenge

#### App Behaviour

1. Sign in using Facebook account and granting access to Facebook albums & photos
2. Buttons to navigate between activities
3. You may select an album in the album activity to fetch the photos inside of it
4. You have the possibility to choose photos inside Pictures activity (by long clicking on them) to upload them to FireBase.

#### Technologies used

These are technologies used in this app

* Android
* Third partie API's

> Firebase ; Facebook (Graph api)

#### How to run the app

> For my case i'm using both my FireBase account to upload to photos and my facebook developper account to test, so to make it work for you, you should apply the coming instruction step by step.

1. Clone the repository.
```git https://github.com/hijikila/HiddenFounder.git```

2. Import the project to your android studio

3. You can either ask me to add you as a Tester of the app or you can change the project ``app/res/values/String.xml``  file and replace ``facebook_app_id`` and ``fb_login_protocol_scheme`` by the ones you get from your facebook developper account.

4. You need to :

> Create a Firebase account if you don't have one already

> Create a new project and import ``google-service.json`` file provided by FireBase to your ``app`` directory inside your project

5. Finally you can install the app to your phone and test it out

#### Things to add
The app needs a couple of fonctionnalities to add to it :
>Connection to your firebase account Activity

>Some code optimizations

I will be pleased if you test it out and hit me by your constructive reviews.
